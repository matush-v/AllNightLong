☐ MVC
☐ ALWAYS USE UNDERSCORE CASING
TODO for Alpha Testing:
  Mathurshan:
    Clock page:
      ☐ Sexy graphics (clock, box, buttons, etc.) @high
      ✔ background @done (15-10-23 21:12)
      ✔ optional second hand - clock onclick and subtle button in corner @done (15-10-23 21:43)
      ☐ curtains
      ☐ Eager.io apps
      ☐ Anything user does is added to the localstorage
      ☐ Big Button for "I'M DONE" that plays rocky song
    Algo:
      ✔ Check for time collisions @high @done (15-10-23 20:48)
        ✔ water should just be removed if there is a collision @done (15-10-23 20:48)
      ✔ if no good nap time, no caffeine @done (15-10-23 20:52)
      ✔ Comment above each function with how it determines the event @done (15-10-23 20:52)
      ✔ As of 10/22/15, the scheduler generates events up to an hour after inputted end time (I put in 5:30am end time and the last event was at 6:30am) @critical @done (15-10-23 18:55)
    Notifications:
      ☐ Every time a user does not complete an event, add it to localstorage and adjust schedule
      ☐ If completed, send feedback to server
      ☐ refreshing page during event time gives multiple notifications

  Sean:
    Clock page:
      ☐ Change global event counter to be in localstorage so it persists over refresh @critical
      ☐ When event is over, remove the dot dynamically (Written, but test when above critical is fixed)
      ☐ Add ratings when 'Done' button is clicked in modal via ajax call to add_rating endpoint
      ☐ Make clock.html page inaccessible if all events in localstorage are in the past
      ☐ Save ratings in localstorage (with time?) so that they can be added to modal even after page refresh
        - Right now stars will be same across all modals (extra or event) until the page is refreshed and they all revert to 0 stars
    Quotes:
      ☐ curtains CSS fix up
    Prettify:
    Creating a schedule:
      ☐ sexy graphics and JS
      ☐ Color code events
      ☐ EC: Scroll down to see later events, scroll up to see recent events
 
 ☐ Bugs from Hackathon presentation
  ☐ Stop notifications when they get to Congratulations page
 
 Late Game:
 ☐ Add site feedback/suggestions button
 ☐ YSLOW, Audit, and W3 validator (last validated 5/3 9:24 PM)
 ☐ Restrict CORS access
 ☐ Ensure that everything still works with bad user input

    * events known about previous event completion (e.g. you didn't walk last time)
    * based off science and user feedback from notifications

  * Extreme Motivation

  * Prettify
    * Add unique way to tell user why we want desktop notifications TODO exists
    * Info box parts like curtains to show event info onmouseover and animates back after
